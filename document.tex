% Following comment is from ijcai97-submit.tex:
% The preparation of these files was supported by Schlumberger Palo Alto
% Research, AT\&T Bell Laboratories, and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.
% Shirley Jowell, of Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, and Peter F.
% Patel-Schneider, of AT\&T Bell Laboratories collaborated on their
% preparation.

% These instructions can be modified and used in other conferences as long
% as credit to the authors and supporting agencies is retained, this notice
% is not changed, and further modification or reuse is not restricted.
% Neither Shirley Jowell nor Peter F. Patel-Schneider can be listed as
% contacts for providing assistance without their prior permission.

% To use for other conferences, change references to files and the
% conference appropriate and use other authors, contacts, publishers, and
% organizations.
% Also change the deadline and address for returning papers and the length and
% page charge instructions.
% Put where the files are available in the appropriate places.

	\maketitle
	
	\begin{abstract}
		The {\it IJCAI--22 Proceedings} will be printed from electronic
		manuscripts submitted by the authors. The electronic manuscript will
		also be included in the online version of the proceedings. This paper
		provides the style instructions.
	\end{abstract}
	
		
	\section{Motivating Example}
	$A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$ is indistinguishable from $C \rightarrow B \rightarrow A$.
	
	We may take a structure $A \rightarrow B$ and replace it with creating a new node $C$ with $A \leftarrow C \rightarrow B$.
	
	\section{Divergence of Bayesian Networks from Causality}
	
	\begin{definition}
		Bayesian networks $G_0$ and $G_1$ are isomorphic if $\forall P: G_0$ is compatible with $P \iff G_1$ is compatible with $P$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{proposition}
		Inverting all the arrows in a Bayesian network is an isomorphism.
	\end{proposition}
