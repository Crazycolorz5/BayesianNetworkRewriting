	\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Motivating Example}
	$A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$ is indistinguishable from $C \rightarrow B \rightarrow A$. However, substituting one structure with another in all cases may not preserve validity of a Bayesian network.
	\begin{figure}[b]
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
		\tikzstyle{VertexStyle} = [shape=rectangle,minimum width=6ex, draw]
		\tikzstyle{EdgeStyle}   = [->,>=stealth']
		
		\SetGraphUnit{1.5}
		\Vertex{Smoking}  \SOWE(Smoking){Chronic Bronchitis} \SOEA(Smoking){Lung Cancer}
		\SOEA(Chronic Bronchitis){Fatigue} \SOEA(Lung Cancer){Mass on X-Ray}
		\Edge[label=?](Smoking)(Chronic Bronchitis) \Edge(Smoking)(Lung Cancer)
		\Edge(Lung Cancer)(Fatigue) \Edge(Lung Cancer)(Mass on X-Ray) \Edge(Chronic Bronchitis)(Fatigue)
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Example of a Bayesian Network. As only conditional probabilities, which are symmetric, are specified, the graph is agnostic to whether the ``?'' edge is in the direction shown or is reversed.}
	\label{dir-ex}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{figure}[b]
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
		\tikzstyle{VertexStyle} = [shape=rectangle,minimum width=6ex, draw]
		\tikzstyle{EdgeStyle}   = [-,>=stealth']
		
		\SetGraphUnit{1.5}
		\Vertex{Smoking}  \SOWE(Smoking){Chronic Bronchitis} \SOEA(Smoking){Lung Cancer}
		\SOEA(Chronic Bronchitis){Fatigue} \SOEA(Lung Cancer){Mass on X-Ray}
		\Edge(Smoking)(Chronic Bronchitis) \Edge(Smoking)(Lung Cancer)
		\draw[thick, ->,>=stealth'](Lung Cancer)--(Fatigue); \Edge(Lung Cancer)(Mass on X-Ray) \draw[thick, ->,>=stealth'](Chronic Bronchitis)--(Fatigue);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Replacing every undirected edge with an edge in an arbitrary direction, without introducing any new v-structures, yields an equivalent Bayesian Network.}
	\label{undir-ex}
	\end{figure}

	With respect to Figure \ref{undir-ex}, the condition that no cycles and no additional v-structures be introduced limits the choice of direction to four options:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The graph as shown in Figure \ref{dir-ex}.
		\item Chronic Bronchitis $\rightarrow$ Smoking $\rightarrow$ Lung Cancer $\rightarrow$ Mass on X-Ray.
		\item Mass on X-Ray $\rightarrow$ Lung Cancer $\rightarrow$ Smoking $\rightarrow$ Chronic Bronchitis.
		\item Chronic Bronchitis $\leftarrow$ Smoking $\leftarrow$ Lung Cancer $\rightarrow$ Mass on X-Ray.
	\end{enumerate}
	Any other choice on arrows would create a new v-structure, either on (Chronic Bronchitis, Smoking, Lung Cancer), or on (Smoking, Lung Cancer, Mass on X-Ray).
	\paragraph{}
	
	We may take a structure $A \rightarrow B$ and replace it with creating a new node $C$ with $A \leftarrow C \rightarrow B$.
	
	\subsection{Divergence of Bayesian Networks from Causality}
	
	\begin{definition}
		Bayesian networks $G_0$ and $G_1$ are isomorphic if $\forall P: G_0$ is compatible with $P \iff G_1$ is compatible with $P$.
	\end{definition}
